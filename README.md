## Rails 3(.1) Depot

This is the classic Depot app from the [Agile Web Development with Rails, 4th edition][1], upgraded to Rails 3.1. It's also a playground of sorts, going beyond the book and upgrading/changing things as I want.

- Upgraded to Rails 3.1.0rc5.  **Welcome to the future**
- Expanding the Admin. **So I can have more power**
- Adding or changing other stuff. **For Science**
